Recommendation engines provide wonderful opportunities to these organizations to not only understand their clientele but also to use that information to increase their revenues. Another important advantage, you can easily integrate a  crude recommendation engine in its interaction with the users and then, on the basis of its performance, make the decision to develop a more  sophisticated version. \n\n### The Million Song Dataset\n\nThe million song dataset is a very popular dataset and is available at https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/. The original dataset contained quantified audio features of around a million songs ranging over multiple years.\n\nAlthough we will not be using this dataset directly, we will be using some parts of it. Several other datasets were spawned from the original million song dataset. One of those datasets was called The Echonest Taste Profile Subset. This particular dataset was created by The Echonest with some undisclosed partners. The dataset contains play counts by anonymous users for songs contained in the million songs dataset. \n\n## Preparing environment and uploading data\nYou can download the this python notebook and data from my [github repository](https://github.com/mgmarques/Studies-on-Kaggle). \n\nThe two datasets can download on Kaggle, [song_data.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/anuragbanerjee/million-song-data-set-subset/downloads/song_data.csv/1) and [count play of 10,000 songs](https://www.kaggle.com/anuragbanerjee/million-song-data-set-subset/downloads/10000.txt/1).\n\n### Import Necessary Packages"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nimport warnings\nwarnings.simplefilter(action = 'ignore', category=FutureWarning)\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\ndef ignore_warn(*args, **kwargs):\n    pass\n\nwarnings.warn = ignore_warn #ignore annoying warning (from sklearn and seaborn)\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport time\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt; plt.rcdefaults()\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom scipy.sparse import coo_matrix\nimport math as mt\nfrom scipy.sparse.linalg import * #used for matrix multiplication\nfrom scipy.sparse.linalg import svds\nfrom scipy.sparse import csc_matrix\nfrom scipy.stats import skew, norm, probplot\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.set(style=\"ticks\", color_codes=True, font_scale=1.5)\ncolor = sns.color_palette()\nsns.set_style('darkgrid')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"7f1aec9f17e7d123812609f26dd2c5e385957119"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Popularity Recommender: Class Vs Packages\nInstead of use any readily available packages for building our recommendation system, let's go use a [class](https://github.com/llSourcell/recommender_live) created by Siraj Raval, that permit to us understand of what goes on behind a recommendation engine.

It make it easier to calculate more complex matrix operations. Matrix factorization methods, also called [matrix decompositions methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_decomposition), are a foundation of linear algebra in computers, even for basic operations such as solving systems of linear equations, calculating the inverse, and calculating the determinant of a matrix.\n\nMatrix factorization can be used to discover latent features between two different kinds of entities. For example, we can try to explain a song in mathematical terms by measuring its beats, tempo, and other such features and then define similar features in terms of the user. Once we have consciously defined such \"features\", we can use them to find matches for a user based on some similarity criteria. You can use matrix factorization to discover these latent features and they seem to work great.\n\nThe starting point of any matrix factorization-based method is the utility matrix, a matrix of user Vs item dimension. Not, this is a sparse matrix, since not all item is used by the user. The process of matrix factorization means finding out a low rank approximation of the utility matrix. So we want to break down the utility matrix U into two low rank matrices so that we can recreate the matrix U by multiplying those two matrices:\n\nAssuming the process helps us identify latent factors/features, meaning as K, our aim is to find two matrices X and Y such that their product (matrix multiplication) approximates R.\n\nX = |U| x K matrix (A matrix with dimensions of num_users * factors)\n\nY = |P| x K matrix (A matrix with dimensions of factors * num_songs)\n\n![iamge](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/dlrsworkshop-161201170151/95/deep-learning-for-audiobased-music-recommendation-15-638.jpg?cb=1480612282)\n\nTo make a recommendation to the user, we can multiply the corresponding user's row from the first matrix by the item matrix and determine the items from the row with maximum ratings. That will become our recommendations for the user. The first matrix represents the association between the users and the latent features, while the second matrix takes care of the associations between items (songs in our case) and the latent features.

We use one of the simplest algorithms, which is the singular value decomposition or SVD. You can follow these steps to determine the factorization of a matrix using the output of SVD function.\n- Factorize the matrix to obtain U, S, and V matrices.\n- Reduce the matrix S to first k components. (The function we are using will only provide k dimensions, so we can skip this step.)\n- Compute the square root of reduced matrix S<sub>k</sub> to obtain the matrix S<sub>k</sub><sup>1/2</sup>.\n- Compute the two resultant matrix U\\*S<sub>k</sub><sup>1/2</sup> and S<sub>k</sub><sup>1/2</sup>\\*V as these will serve as our two factorized matrices\n\nWe can then generate the prediction of user i for product j by taking the dot product of the i<sup>th</sup> row of the first matrix with the j<sup>th</sup> column of the second matrix. \n\nLet's create tree functions to help us on it:\n- ***compute_svd***: It use the svds function provided by the scipy library to break down our utility matrix into three different matrices, and prosed with the others tree steps above.\n- ***compute_estimated_matrix***: use the decomposed matrices by SVD and provide the predictions."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"2f6dcd49fb63b703d602e52493331130f96960b5","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"def compute_svd(urm, K):\n    U, s, Vt = svds(urm, K)\n\n    dim = (len(s), len(s))\n    S = np.zeros(dim, dtype=np.float32)\n    for i in range(0, len(s)):\n        S[i,i] = mt.sqrt(s[i])\n\n    U = csc_matrix(U, dtype=np.float32)\n    S = csc_matrix(S, dtype=np.float32)\n    Vt = csc_matrix(Vt, dtype=np.float32)\n    \n    return U, S, Vt\n\ndef compute_estimated_matrix(urm, U, S, Vt, uTest, K, test):\n    rightTerm = S*Vt \n    max_recommendation = 250\n    estimatedRatings = np.zeros(shape=(MAX_UID, MAX_PID), dtype=np.float16)\n    recomendRatings = np.zeros(shape=(MAX_UID,max_recommendation ), dtype=np.float16)\n    for userTest in uTest:\n        prod = U[userTest, :]*rightTerm\n        estimatedRatings[userTest, :] = prod.todense()\n        recomendRatings[userTest, :] = (-estimatedRatings[userTest, :]).argsort()[:max_recommendation]\n    return recomendRatings\n\ndef show_recomendations(uTest, num_recomendations = 10):\n    for user in uTest:\n        print('-'*70)\n        print(\"Recommendation for user id {}\".format(user))\n        rank_value = 1\n        i = 0\n        while (rank_value <  num_recomendations + 1):\n            so = uTest_recommended_items[user,i:i+1][0]\n            if (small_set.user[(small_set.so_index_value == so) & (small_set.us_index_value == user)].count()==0):\n                song_details = small_set[(small_set.so_index_value == so)].\\\n                    drop_duplicates('so_index_value')[['title','artist_name']]\n                print(\"The number {} recommended song is {} BY {}\".format(rank_value, \n                                                                      list(song_details['title'])[0],\n                                                                      list(song_details['artist_name'])[0]))\n                rank_value+=1\n            i += 1","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"0e59ed4df823c626b0af4a689496044876e6418e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The first thing that we notice is that we have no concept of \"rating\" in our data.
